A polygraph test program for arduino. 

The Baumann Company™ is proud to present our very first Arduino device: a polygraph test! Have suspicions 
about your boyfriend or girlfriend’s late nights at the office? Scared that your parents are lying when 
they say they will leave you the house? Want to make sure your dog is not going through your garbage when
you are not home? Simply set them up to the polygraph test, ask your questions, and see your results! It
is that easy. 
	
This is the simple program that runs the polygraph tester I made as my first arduino project. The code was only possible
thanks to the great documentation of Pulse Sensor Amped, which was the heart rate monitor used in this project.
The example code written by Joel Murphy and Yury Gitman was edited for use in this project. As for a short review,
if you need a heart rate monitor, I have nothing but great things to say about it.    www.pulsesensor.com
